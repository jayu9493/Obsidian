### In short:
The load at which the inductive and capacitive reactive volt-amperes are equal and opposite, such load is called surge impedance load.

In **surge impedance** loading, the voltage and current are in the same phase at all the point of the line. When the surge impedance of the line has terminated the power delivered by it is called surge impedance loading.

**Surge impedance** loading is also defined as the power load in which the total reactive power of the lines becomes zero. The reactive power generated by the shunt capacitance is consumed by the series inductance of the line.

If the load is less than the **SIL**, reactive volt-amperes are generated, and the voltage at the receiving end is greater than the sending end voltage. On the other hand, if the **SIL** is greater than the load, the *voltage at receiving end is smaller* because the *line absorbs reactive power.*
