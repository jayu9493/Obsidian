## Induction Machine Mindmap ^25afcc18-b9e4-470a
- Motor
	- Three phase induction motor
		- Construction
			- Squirrel cage rotor type
				- rotor is short circuited through end rings
			- slip ring or wound rotor type
				- can attach external resistance
		- Torque
			- Maximum and minimum torqe
				- Maximum torque condition
				- minimum torque condition
			- starting torque
				- slip is equal to 1
			- toque-slip characteristics
			- Torque-speed characteristics
		- Rotating magnetic field
			- it is 3/2 (phi)m
		- Slip topic
		- Power flow diagram
		- Equivalent circuit model
			- stator equivalent model
			- rotor equivalent model
			- complete equivalent model
				- referred to stator is more important
		- Determination of efficiency
			- Block rotor test / short circuit test
				- slip ring motors are short-circuited with the help of
				slip rings and cage motors are already short-circuited through end rings.
			- No load test / open circuit test
				- measures no-load current
					- It supplies to reactance and core winding (resistance)
				- power measured is constant iron losses, friction and windage losses
					- windage losses can be separated from total losses
					as iron losses are dependent on flux density.
		- Starting methods of Induction motors
			- DOL Starter
				- overload and undervoltage protection
			- Star/Delta starter
				- in star configuration motor starting current is
				1/3 of in delta configuration, same goes for torque.
			- Auto-transformer starter
			- slip ring motor - resistor attachment
		- speed control methods of induction motors
			- Pole changing
				- method of subsequent poles
				- stator winding arrangements
			- stator voltage control
			- supply frequency
				- v/f ratio to be constant
					- if v/f ratio is not satidfied then machine will go
					into the saturation region
			- rotor resistance
				- only possible in slip ring motor
			- slip energy recovery
				- static scherbius drive
				- only possible slip ring motor
		- Application of polyphase induction motors
			- Class A
			- Class B
			- Class C
			- Class D
	- single phase induction motor
		- Why not self starting?
- Generator
	- Induction Generator
