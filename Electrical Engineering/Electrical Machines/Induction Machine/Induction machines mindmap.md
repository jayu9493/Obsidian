# Induction Machine Mindmap

## Motor

### Three phase induction motor

#### Construction
- Squirrel cage rotor type
	- rotor is short circuited through end rings
- slip ring or wound rotor type
	- can attach external resistance

#### Torque
- Maximum and minimum torqe
	- Maximum torque condition
	- minimum torque condition
- starting torque
	- slip is equal to 1
- toque-slip characteristics
- Torque-speed characteristics

#### Rotating magnetic field
- it is 3/2 (phi)m

#### Slip topic

#### Power flow diagram

#### Equivalent circuit model
- stator equivalent model
- rotor equivalent model
- complete equivalent model
	- referred to stator is more important

#### Determination of efficiency
- Block rotor test / short circuit test
	- slip ring motors are short-circuited with the help of
	slip rings and cage motors are already short-circuited through end rings.
- No load test / open circuit test
	- measures no-load current
		- It supplies to reactance and core winding (resistance)
	- power measured is constant iron losses, friction and windage losses
		- windage losses can be separated from total losses
		as iron losses are dependent on flux density.

#### Starting methods of Induction motors
- DOL Starter
	- overload and undervoltage protection
- Star/Delta starter
	- in star configuration motor starting current is
	1/3 of in delta configuration, same goes for torque.
- Auto-transformer starter
- slip ring motor - resistor attachment

#### speed control methods of induction motors
- Pole changing
- stator voltage control
- supply frequency
- rotor resistance
	- only possible in slip ring motor
- slip energy recovery
	- static scherbius drive
	- only possible slip ring motor

#### Application of polyphase induction motors
- Class A
- Class B
- Class C
- Class D

### single phase induction motor

#### Why not self starting?
