#### What should be the air gap of synchronous generator?
Ans:  The optimum air gap in a synchronous generator is generally determined by the design specifications of the generator and the operating conditions in which it will be used. Typically, the air gap is kept as small as possible while still allowing for proper operation and cooling of the generator.

The air gap is typically measured in millimetres and can range from a few millimetres for small generators to several centimetres for large generators. The exact value of the air gap will depend on the size and design of the generator, as well as the type of materials used in its construction.

It is important to maintain the proper air gap in a synchronous generator to ensure optimal performance and reliability. If the air gap becomes too large, the generator may produce less output power and may be more prone to mechanical failure. If the air gap becomes too small, the generator may produce harmonics and may be more prone to overheating.
## What is armature reaction?
- when current flows through the armature winding (stator), the resulting MMF produce flux. The **armature flux** reacts with the **main pole flux** causing the resulting flux to be more or less.
- The effect of armature flux on the flux provided by the flux produced by the rotor filed poles is called armature reaction.
#### Chat-GPT (explained like i am five)
- ***chat-GPT:*** Alright! Imagine you have a toy car with a magnet inside, and this magnet makes the car move when you turn it on. Now, think of another magnet that you can move around. When you bring this second magnet close to the toy car's magnet, it can change how the toy car's magnet works. It might make the car go slower, or it could make the car move in a different way. In an alternator (which is like a machine that makes electricity), there's a part that spins and makes a magnetic field, just like your toy car's magnet. When the alternator makes electricity, it also creates a second magnetic field. **This second magnetic field can change how the first one works, just like how moving your second magnet near the toy car's magnet changes how the car moves.** So, armature reaction is like when the second magnet messes with the first magnet in your toy car, but it happens inside an alternator with magnetic fields.
