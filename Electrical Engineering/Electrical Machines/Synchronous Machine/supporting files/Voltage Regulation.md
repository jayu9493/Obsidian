## What is voltage regulation?
- Voltage regulation in an electrical machine, like a transformer or an alternator, refers to the ability of the machine to maintain a constant output voltage despite changes in the load (the amount of electricity being drawn by devices connected to it).

- zero voltage regulation is preferred, means low value of VR is good.
