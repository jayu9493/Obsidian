### classification of systems
1. **Linear and non-linear system**
	- A system which follows these two properties then they are called linear system: *1. Additivity, 2. Homogeneity* 
	- *Additivity:*![[Pasted image 20240922171835.png | center | 600]]
	- *Homogeneity:*![[Pasted image 20240922171931.png | center | 500]]
2. **Time variant and time-invariant system**

### Linear Time-Invariant system
- The system which is linear and have time variance in property it is called Linear time-invariant system.
