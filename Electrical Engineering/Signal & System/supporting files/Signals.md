### Classification of signals:
1. **Analog and digital signal:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240921182233.png | center | 530]]
2. **Continuous time and discrete time signal**
3. **Multichannel and multidimensional signal**
	###### *Definition of both signals:* ![[Pasted image 20240921181547.png | center | 750 ]]

### Operations on signals:
- Mainly three types of operations are performed on signals *with respect to time*:
	1. Time scaling: 
		- ![[Pasted image 20241006220221.png | center | 700]]
	2. Time Reversal
		- 
	3. Time shifting
		- 
- There are 5 types of operation to do with respect to Amplitude(Dependent variable):
	1. Amplitude scaling
	2. Signal addition/subtraction
	3. signal multiplication
	4. Differentiation
	5. Integration
