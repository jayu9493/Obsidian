#### Working:
- working of chiller is mainly comprised of following components:
1. **A compressor** : The compressor within an industrial chiller extracts the hot refrigerant vapour, and pumps it into the condenser.
2. **condenser** : Here, the refrigerant vapor condenses, releasing the heat into the cooling water or air. The condensed refrigerant liquid then moves into the expansion valve.
3. **Evaporator** : Kicking off the chilling process, the evaporator absorbs heat from process water within the chiller unit, which then moves to the compressor.
4. **Expansion valve** : The expansion valve reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid refrigerant, allowing the liquid to evaporate back into a gas, ready to get funneled into the evaporator again.
