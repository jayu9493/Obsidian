# Definations:

- **What is MMBtu?**
	- MMBtu is acronym for Metric Million British Thermal Unit, and it is a unit traditionally used to measure heat content or energy value. It is widely associated with measurement of natural gas in the energy terms globally.
	- A Btu is defined as amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one 1 pound (0.454 kg) of liquid water by 1 °F (0.556 °C) at a constant pressure of one atmosphere. When 1 Btu is represented in a unit of million, it is termed as Metric Million British Thermal Unit (MMBtu).
- **What is Calorific value?**
	- The amount of heat produced by the complete combustion of a material or fuel. It is measured in units of energy per amount of material, e.g. Btu, SCM, Joule etc.…
- **How we can convert / compare SCM and MMBtu?**
	- The conversion/comparison between SCM and MMBtu can be done based on 1 MMBtu = 252,000 Kilocalorie. Gas consumption in SCM and MMBtu would be separately mentioned in your gas bill/invoice. Assuming NCV of 8350 kcal/SCM 1 MMBtu will approximately be equal to 30.12 SCM. . This value may vary slightly depending on actual calorific value of gas.
