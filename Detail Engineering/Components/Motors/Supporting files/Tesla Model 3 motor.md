it abondan the conventional induction motor and use IPMSynRM.
#### IPMSynRM:











#### Induction Motor disadvantages:
The induction motor is efficient but not up to the mark it looses 3-4% of energy when going on to cruise mode & it has low starting torque.
#####  Solution:
parament magnet motor offers high starting torque operating with controller and it does not feel energy loss.
It can be made by replacing the rotor part of induction motor by permanent magnet.
It does not need any current to produce the rotating magnetic field
