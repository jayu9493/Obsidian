- Undervoltage protection (ANSI 27) constantly monitors the system voltage. If the voltage level of an installation goes out of its acceptable limits, the information provided by undervoltage protection can be used to initiate appropriate action to restore good operating conditions in the installation.
- Under voltage protection 27 is of the following two types-
- **ANSI 27-1** – In this system, each voltage is monitored independently. The protection initiates when one of three monitored voltages falls below the threshold Vmin1, as shown in figure-1.
- **ANSI 27-2** – In this protection, the three voltages are monitored together. The protection initiates when all three monitored voltages fall below the threshold Vmin2 as shown in figure-2.

### Characteristics of Under Voltage Protection
The following are the characteristics of under voltage protection-
- It has a definite time delay.
- Under voltage protection has an instantaneous reset time.
- It has fixed 98% hysteresis. here 98% hysterisis means once the voltage reaches the 98% mark then only relay will reset not before that, the system ensures that the voltage is stable and sufficiently above the trip point before resuming operation.
- It has a minimum breaking time of 50 ms.
- It has a maximum breaking time of 140 ms (with a time delay of 0 sec), when the system is in less severe state then relay will trip at 140 ms.
