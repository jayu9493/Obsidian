### Why it is used?
- The primary function of a differential relay is to monitor the **difference between incoming and outgoing currents** in a protected system or equipment. Under normal operating conditions, the incoming and outgoing currents are balanced, and the difference is negligible.
- However, when a fault occurs, this balance is disrupted, leading to an imbalance in the currents. The differential relay detects this discrepancy and triggers a trip signal to isolate the faulty section, thereby preventing further damage to the equipment and ensuring the safety of the power system.
- The basic principle of a differential relay is the comparison of two or more currents entering and leaving a particular section of a power system.
### Types of Differential Relays:
 1. **Percentage Differential Relay:** This type of relay is designed to operate when the difference between the ***incoming and outgoing currents*** exceeds a ***predetermined percentage of the total current.*** It offers improved sensitivity and stability compared to other differential relays and is commonly used to protect transformers and generators.
2. **High Impedance Differential Relay:** This relay operates based on the ***voltage developed across a high impedance*** connected in the relayâ€™s operating coil. It is widely used in busbar protection schemes due to its simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
3. **Low Impedance Differential Relay:** In contrast to the high impedance differential relay, the low impedance differential relay operates based on the ***current difference between the incoming and outgoing currents***. It is typically used in transformer protection schemes and offers faster operation and better sensitivity.
### Applications of Differential Relays:
1. **Transformer Protection:** Differential relays are widely used to protect ***transformers from internal faults*** such as winding short-circuits and ground faults. They help prevent catastrophic failures and extend the operational life of transformers.
2. **Generator Protection:** Differential protection is essential for generators to detect stator winding faults and prevent extensive damage to the equipment. These relays are designed to provide fast and reliable protection for generator units.
3. **Motor Protection:** Differential relays are also used to protect motors from internal faults, ensuring their safe and efficient operation. They help minimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs associated with motor failures.
4. **Busbar Protection:** Busbars, which distribute power within a substation, are protected using high impedance differential relays. These relays can quickly isolate busbar faults, preventing widespread power outages and equipment damage.

### Components in Differential relay:
- there is one operating coil which is used as reference for this relay. When some fault occurs current will flow from this coil which is sensed by relay and sends tripping command.
### Why differential relay is used even if Buchholz relay is used?
- 1st Difference: Differential relay is used for bigger Transformer like more than 5 MVA rating while Buchholz relays is used for small transformer.
- 2nd Difference: Both relays are used for internal faults but if fault occur on something like Bushing where they gets short circuit if that case Buchholz relay will not work, but Differential relay will sense this fault and trip the transformer. [[zones of protection]]
- 3rd Difference: Differential relay have less response time then Buchholz relay which is necessary for some transformer.
