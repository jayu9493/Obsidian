| Sr. No | Relay                                      | General use case                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | [[Under Voltage Relay_27]]                 | Detects and trips when voltage falls below a set threshold.                                                   |
| 2.     | [[50_51_Overcurrent_relay]]                | Protects against excessive current by tripping the circuit.                                                   |
| 3.     | [[87_Differential Protection Relay]]       | Trips when there's a difference between input and output currents, indicating a fault.                        |
| 4      | Motor Protection relay                     | Trips the motor supply to protect the motor and safeguard the further system.                                 |
| 5      | Power factor relay                         | A relay that operates when the power factor in an AC circuit rises above or falls below a predetermined value |
| 6      | [[95_TCS(Trip circuit supervision) Relay]] | It monitor the healthiness of circuit and return the error if not ok.                                         |
