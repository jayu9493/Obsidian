Petroleum refinery in [Anacortes, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacortes,_Washington "Anacortes, Washington"), United States

**Petroleum refining processes** are the [chemical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "Chemical engineering") processes and other facilities used in petroleum refineries (also referred to as oil refineries) to transform [crude oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil "Crude oil") into useful products such as [liquefied petroleum gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas "Liquefied petroleum gas") (LPG), [gasoline or petrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline "Gasoline"), [kerosene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene "Kerosene"), [jet fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel"), [diesel oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_oil "Diesel oil") and [fuel oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil "Fuel oil").<sup id="cite_ref-Handwerk_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-Handwerk-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Leffler_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-Leffler-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>

Refineries and petroleum industries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks. Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location, desired products and economic considerations.

Some modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 [barrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit) "Barrel (unit)") (127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters) per day of crude oil.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Prior to the nineteenth century, petroleum was known and utilized in various fashions in [Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon "Babylon"), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines"), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") and along the Caspian Sea. The modern history of the petroleum industry is said to have begun in 1846 when Abraham Gessner of [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia "Nova Scotia"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") devised a process to produce kerosene from coal. Shortly thereafter, in 1854, [Ignacy Lukasiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Lukasiewicz "Ignacy Lukasiewicz") began producing kerosene from hand-dug oil wells near the town of [Krosno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krosno "Krosno"), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"). The first large petroleum refinery was built in [Ploesti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploie%C8%99ti "Ploiești"), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") in 1856 using the abundant oil available in Romania.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

In North America, the first oil well was drilled in 1858 by [James Miller Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Miller_Williams "James Miller Williams") in Ontario, Canada. In the United States, the petroleum industry began in 1859 when [Edwin Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Drake "Edwin Drake") found oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania.<sup id="cite_ref-WDL_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-WDL-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The industry grew slowly in the 1800s, primarily producing kerosene for oil lamps. In the early twentieth century, the introduction of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles created a market for gasoline that was the impetus for fairly rapid growth of the petroleum industry. The early finds of petroleum like those in Ontario and [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania") were soon outstripped by large oil "booms" in [Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma "Oklahoma"), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas") and [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>

Prior to World War II in the early 1940s, most petroleum refineries in the United States consisted simply of [crude oil distillation units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#Thecrude_oil_distillation_unit) (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil distillation units). Some refineries also had [vacuum distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_distillation "Vacuum distillation") units as well as [thermal cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cracking "Thermal cracking") units such as [visbreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visbreaker "Visbreaker") (viscosity breakers, units to lower the [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity") of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or within a few years after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.

In the United States, for various complex economic and political reasons, the construction of new refineries came to a virtual stop in about the 1980s. However, many of the existing refineries in the United States have revamped many of their units and/or, constructed add-on units in order to: increase their crude oil processing capacity, increase the [octane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane "Octane") rating of their product gasoline, lower the [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") content of their diesel fuel and home heating fuels to comply with environmental regulations and comply with environmental air pollution and water pollution requirements.

## Crude oil - Distillation Unit

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petroleum_refining_processes&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Crude oil - Distillation Unit")\]

The crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which are then processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the [_atmospheric distillation unit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_distillation_of_crude_oil "Atmospheric distillation of crude oil") because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure.<sup id="cite_ref-Handwerk_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-Handwerk-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Leffler_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-Leffler-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_refining_processes#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

Below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride).

Following the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about 398 °C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit.

The cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.

As shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called _sidecuts_. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.
